* <b>Dataset</b>: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip [90Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: The accelerometer and gyroscope reading from a Samsung phone was caputered by 30 subject
while they where performing six different activities including: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.
From the raw data, various attributes were analyzed and created.  The total number of attributes is 561.
Each raw observation contains 128 columns for information on 9 different data from raw sensor data.  Each data contains values for x, y, z.
The test and train data were part of the data set wherein the test data set has a total of 2947 observations and the train dataset had a total of 7352 observations for a total of 10,299 observations.  The goal of the assignment is to create a unified data set containing all of the 10,299 observations
on 561 variables merging with appropriate subject number and activity.  The activity and columns have to be relabelled in such a way it readable in English.
Upon creating the dataset analysis is peformed on the dataset to produce the tidy data set.
